Schema Registry serves as a central hub to handle and validate schemas for message data related to Kafka topics. 
It also manages serialization and deserialization of data over the network. 
This aids producers and consumers in maintaining data consistency and compatibility as schemas change. 

See [How to](./schemahowto) to learn how to configure the schema registry to use in various scenarios.

See [Compatibility](./schemacompatibility) page for details of compatibility settings.

See [Rest API](./schemarest) in case you want to directly access the schema registry.
