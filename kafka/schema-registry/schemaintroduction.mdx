Schema Registry serves as a central hub to handle and validate schemas for message data related to Kafka topics. 
It also manages serialization and deserialization of data over the network. 
This aids producers and consumers in maintaining data consistency and compatibility as schemas change. 

See [How to](./schemahowto) to find how to configure to use schema registry in various different scenarios.

See [Compatiblity](./schemacompatibility) page for details of compatibility settings.

See [Rest API](./schemarest) in case you want to directly access to the schema registry.
